We show that the bounded-from-below conditions for the Standard Model extended by an $SU(2)$ quadruplet strongly constrain the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-breaking Higgs portal and can bound the Higgs trilinear coupling close to its Standard Model value. For TeV-scale quadruplet masses in models with custodial symmetry violation, these constraints can be a few times stronger than constraints from electroweak precision measurements.

However, the relatively recent observational constraints on the speed of gravitational waves $c_{\\textrm{GW}}$ have resulted in many of those models being ruled out because they predict $c_{\\textrm{GW}} \\neq c$ generally. While these were formulated in the metric formalism of gravity, we put forward a new quintessence model with the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet action but in Weyl geometry, where the connection is not metric compatible. We find the fixed points of the dynamical system under some assumptions and determine their stability via linear analysis. The past evolution of the Universe can be reproduced correctly, but the late Universe constraints on $c_{\\textrm{GW}}$ are grossly violated. Moreover, at these later stages tensor modes suffer from the gradient instabilities.

Without imposing limits from requirement of providing a viable dark matter candidate, i.e. taking into account only other experimental and theoretical constraints, we find that the first order phase transition in this model can be strong enough to lead to a detectable signal. However, direct detection and the dark matter thermal relic density constraint calculated with the state-of-the-art method including the impact of early kinetic decoupling, very strongly limit the parameter space of the model explaining all of dark matter and providing observable GW peak amplitude.

We prove that for all such Palatini $F(R)$'s, there exists a universal strong coupling limit corresponding to a quadratic $F(R)$ with the wrong sign for the linear term and a cosmological constant in the Jordan frame. In such a limit, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ does not depend on the original inflaton potential, while the scalar spectral index $n_s$ does. Unfortunately, the system is ill-defined out of the slow-roll regime. A possible way out is to upgrade to a $F(R,X)$ model, with $X$ the Jordan frame inflaton kinetic term. Such a modification essentially leaves the inflationary predictions unaffected.",

The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\u03c3$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\u03c3$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter).

Thus, they are ideal laboratories to study the interplay between the galaxies and the gas. In this context, the Shapley supercluster (SSC) stands out since it hosts the highest number of galaxies in the local universe. In addition, it is detected in both X-rays and via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, making it ideal for a multi-wavelength study. Applying for the first time a filament-finder based on graphs, T-REx, on a spectroscopic galaxy catalogue, we uncovered the 3D filamentary network in and around SSC. Simultaneously, we used a large sample of photometric galaxies with information on their star formation rates (SFR) in order to investigate the quenching of star formation in the SSC environments which we define with the gas distribution in the Planck tSZ map and the ROSAT X-ray map. We confirm filaments already observed in the distribution of galaxies of the SSC, and detect new ones. We observe the quenching of star formation as a function of the gas, and show a general trend of decreasing SFR where the tSZ and X-ray signals are the highest. Within these regions, we also observe a rapid decline of the number of star-forming galaxies, coinciding with an increasing number of transitioning and passive galaxies. Within the filaments, the fraction of passive galaxies is larger than outside filaments, irrespective of the gas pressure. Our results suggest the zone of influence of the SSC, in which galaxies are pre-processed and quenched, is well defined by the tSZ signal that combines the density and temperature of the environments.",

We show that only a small fraction of dark matter can consist of stellar mass PBHs when the abundance is calculated using threshold statistics.

One such alternative gravity approach is metric-affine Palatini $f(\\hat{R})$ theory. By now routine gravitational wave detections have opened a promising avenue of searching for modified gravity effects. Future expected cases of strong lensing of gravitational waves will enhance this opportunity further. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the propagation and gravitational lensing of gravitational waves in Palatini $f(\\hat R)$ gravity and compare it with general relativity. Using the WKB approximation we explore the geometric-optical limit of lensing and derive the corrections to the measured luminosity distance of the gravitational source. In addition, we study the lensing by the Singular Isothermal Sphere lens model and show that Palatini $f(\\hat{R})$ modifies the lensing potential and hence the deflection angle. Then we show that the lens model and chosen theory of gravity influences the rotation of the gravitational wave polarization plane through the deflection angle. To be more specific we discuss the $f(\\hat R)=\\hat R+\u03b1\\hat R^2$ gravity theory and find that the modifications comparing to general relativity are negligible if the upper bound of $\u03b1\\sim 10^{9} \\, $m$^2$ suggested in the literature is adopted.

We show that inflation is characterized by a \"master\" trajectory from a saddle-type de Sitter fixed point to a stable node fixed point, approximated by slow roll conditions (presented for the first time in the Palatini formalism). We show that, despite different underlying equations, the fixed point structure and properties of many models are congruent in metric and Palatini, which explains their qualitative similarities and their suitability for driving inflation. On the other hand, the global phase portraits reveal how even models which predict the same values for observable perturbations differ, both to the extent of the phase space physically available to their trajectories, as well as their past asymptotic states. We also note how the slow roll conditions tend to underestimate the end of inflationary accelerated expansion experienced by the true nonlinear \"master\" solution.

The CMS ECAL is a scintillating lead-tungstate crystal calorimeter, with a silicon strip preshower detector in the forward region that provides precise measurements of the energy and the time-of-arrival of electrons and photons. The successful operation of the ECAL is crucial for a broad range of physics goals, ranging from observing the Higgs boson and measuring its properties, to other standard model measurements and searches for new phenomena. Precise calibration, alignment, and monitoring of the ECAL response are important ingredients to achieve these goals. To face the challenges posed by the higher luminosity, which characterized the operation of the LHC in Run 2, the procedures established during the 2011-2012 run of the LHC have been revisited and new methods have been developed for the energy measurement and for the ECAL calibration.

  "10.1051/0004-6361/202450564": "[Abridged] The gas distribution in galaxies is smooth on large scales, but is usually time-dependent and inhomogeneous on smaller scales. The time-dependence originates from processes such as cloud formation, their collisions, and supernovae (SNe) explosions, which also create inhomogeneities. The inhomogeneities in the matter distribution give rise to variations in the local galactic gravitational potential, which can contribute to dynamically coupling the gas disc to the stellar and the dark matter (DM) components of the galaxy. Specifically, multiple SNe occurring in young stellar clusters give rise to superbubbles (SBs), which modify the local acceleration field and alter the energy and momentum of stars or DM particles traversing them, in broad analogy to the dynamical friction caused by a massive object. Our aim is to quantify how the acceleration field from SBs causes dynamical friction and contributes to the secular evolution of galaxies. In order to assess this, we constructed the time-dependent density modifications to the gas distribution that mimics a SB. By evaluating the acceleration field from these density modifications, we were able to see how the momentum or angular momentum of the gas hosting the SBs changes when stars pass through the SB. Combining the effects of all the stars and SBs, we constructed an empirical approximation formula for the momentum loss in homogeneous and isotropic cases. We find that the rate at which the gas disc loses its specific angular momentum via the above process is up to 4% per Gyr, which translates to under one-half of its original value over the lifetime of the disc. For comparison, the mass transfer rate from SBs is about one order of magnitude less than from gas turbulence, and hence the SB contribution should be included to account for the gas migration rate more accurately than 10%.",

This allows the search to set the most stringent constraints to date on the branching fraction of the top quark decay to a lepton, an up-type quark (u or c), and a down-type quark (d, s, or b). The results improve the previous bounds by three to six orders of magnitude based on the fermion flavor combination of the baryon number violating interactions.",

However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \\simeq 0.0667$ is in tension with current observational bounds. In this work, we investigate how this tension can be alleviated in the Palatini formulation of gravity. We consider two classes of models based on simple monomial potentials: (i) models with a non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and gravity, and (ii) models including an $\u03b1R^2$ term. In the first case, we find that a quadratic potential with a linear non-minimal coupling leads to the linear inflation attractor, with $r$ suppressed as $\u03be$ increases. In the second case, we show that a linear potential can yield values of $r$ consistent with observations for sufficiently large $\u03b1$. Our results demonstrate that simple monomial models can remain compatible with current observational constraints when embedded in the Palatini framework.",

Subsequent simulation studies have shown qualitative agreement with these findings, but quantitative discrepancies remain due to differences in data and methods, which require verification. To address this issue, we adopt the same methodology as used in the observations to identify filament spin from the galaxy distribution constructed from a hydrodynamic simulation. Using the same approach to measure filament spin, we find that the simulation results closely match the observational findings, with only minor discrepancies arising from slight differences in the fraction of filaments classified as dynamically cold or hot based on their dynamic temperature. Additionally, an analysis of how filament spin affects the galaxy spin-filament correlation shows that filaments with strong spin signals and dynamically cold have a greater impact on the galaxy spin-filament correlation than those with weaker spin signals and dynamically hot filaments. These results not only provide further evidence that cosmic filaments exhibit spin, but also highlight the importance of this rotation in the acquisition of angular momentum by individual galaxies. Future studies exploring the influence of filament spin on galaxy spin may shed light on the physical origins of filaments and the angular momentum of galaxies.",

Modern deep surveys allow us to build well-characterized samples of groups up to the regime where structures were taking shape. We aimed to build the largest deep catalog of galaxy groups to date over the COSMOS-Web field effective area of 0.45 deg$^2$, leveraging the deep high quality data of the new COSMOS-Web photometric catalog resulted from the James Webb Space Telescope observations of the COSMOS-Web field. We performed the group search with the AMICO algorithm, a linear matched filter based on an analytical model for the group signal. AMICO has already been tested in wide and deep field surveys, including COSMOS data up to $z=2$. In this work, we tested the algorithm performances at even higher redshift and searched for protocluster cores at $z>2$. We compiled a list of known protoclusters in COSMOS at $2 \\leq z \\leq 3.7$, matched them with our detections and studied the clustering of the detected cores. We estimated purity and completeness of our sample by creating data-driven mocks with the SinFoniA code and linked signal-to-noise to purity.

We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations.

At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign.

In this work we construct a hybrid set of variables which allow the depiction of both the initial and final states distinctly in nonsingular manner.

The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation.

These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for by systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also a growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After reviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological parameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising array of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys.

We confront the angular power spectra of these observables measured under shells centered on 11 different redshifts with theoretical expectations derived from a linear Boltzmann code ({\\tt ARFCAMB}). Overall we find that J-PLUS DR3 data are well reproduced by our linear, simplistic model.

Part of this limitation arises on top of our ignorance on how such systematics actually impact the observed galaxy/quasar fields. In this work we develop a generic, hybrid model for an arbitrary number of systematics that may modulate observations in both an additive and a multiplicative way, after applying a nonlinear power law transformation. This model allows us devising a novel algorithm that addresses the identification and correction for either additive and/or multiplicative contaminants. We test this model on galaxy mocks and systematics templates inspired from data of the third data release of the {\\it Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS). We find that our method clearly outperforms standard methods that assume either an additive or multiplicative character for all contaminants in scenarios where both characters are actually acting on the observed data. In simpler scenarios where only an additive or multiplicative imprint on observations is considered, our hybrid method does not lie far behind the corresponding simplified, additive/multiplicative methods. Nonetheless, in scenarios of mild/low impact of systematics, we find that our hybrid approach converges towards the standard method that assumes additive contamination, as predicted by our model describing systematics.

Using the Uchuu simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population. Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and redshift.

We find a normalisation and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about 0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%.

Searches for alternative scenarios predicting more complex dark sectors with multiple new particles and new forces are also presented. Many of these models include long-lived particles, which could manifest themselves with striking unconventional signatures with relatively small amounts of background. Searches for such particles are discussed and their impact on dark-sector scenarios is evaluated. Many results and interpretations have been newly obtained for this Report.",

These studies provide detailed macroscopic and microscopic probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created at the LHC energies, a medium characterized by the highest temperature and smallest baryon-chemical potential ever reached in the laboratory. Numerous observables related to high-density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) were studied, leading to some of the most impactful and qualitatively novel results in the 40-year history of the field. Using a dedicated high-multiplicity trigger in the first pp run, CMS discovered that small collision systems can exhibit signs of collectivity, a generic phenomenon with significant implications and presently understood to affect essentially all soft physics processes. This observation opened new paths to understand how fluidity and plasma properties emerge in QCD matter as a function of system size. Measurements of jet quenching have reached a completely new level of detail by directly assessing, for the first time, the medium modification of parton showers, as opposed to simply observing leading hadrons or di-hadrons. The first fully reconstructed beauty hadron and heavy-flavor jet nuclear modifications were also measured. The large size of the event samples, the precision of the measurements, and the extension of the probed kinematical phase space, allowed many other hard probes of the QGP medium to be explored in detail, leading to multiple groundbreaking findings. In particular, the seminal measurements of bottomonium suppression patterns answer fundamental questions that have been actively pursued, both theoretically and experimentally, by the community since the mid-1980s. We conclude by outlining the opportunities offered by the continuation of this physics program at the LHC.",

The novel data-scouting strategy trades complete event information for higher event rates, while keeping the data bandwidth within limits. Data parking involves storing a large amount of raw detector data collected by algorithms with low trigger thresholds to be processed when sufficient computational power is available to handle such data. The research program of the CMS Collaboration is greatly expanded with these techniques. The implementation, performance, and physics results obtained with data scouting and data parking in CMS over the last decade are discussed in this Report, along with new developments aimed at further improving low-mass physics sensitivity over the next years of data taking.",

Its value indicates a Yukawa coupling close to unity, and the resulting strong ties to Higgs physics make the top quark mass a crucial ingredient for understanding essential aspects of the electroweak sector of the SM. This review offers the first comprehensive overview of the top quark mass measurements performed by the CMS Collaboration using the data collected at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV. Moreover, a detailed description of the top quark event reconstruction is provided and dedicated studies of the dominant uncertainties in the modelling of the signal processes are discussed. The interpretation of the experimental results on the top quark mass in terms of the SM Lagrangian parameter is challenging and is a focus of an ongoing discussion in the theory community. The CMS Collaboration has performed two main types of top quark mass measurements, addressing this challenge from different perspectives: highly precise `direct' measurements, based on reconstructed top quark decay products and relying exclusively on Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as `indirect' measurements, where the simulations are employed to determine parton-level cross sections that are compared to fixed-order perturbative calculations. Recent mass extractions using Lorentz-boosted top quarks open a new avenue of measurements based on top quark decay products contained in a single particle jet, with promising prospects for accurate theoretical interpretations.",

The former, aided by the high-multiplicity triggers, allows probing for potential jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity events (with up to 400 charged particles), for which collective phenomena consistent with quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet formation were previously observed. The ratios of $x_j$ distributions for high- to low-multiplicity events are used to quantify the possible medium effects. These ratios are consistent with simulations of the hard-scattering process that do not include QGP production.

This paper presents new methods of track reconstruction, measurements of strip-level detection efficiencies, cross-checks of the LHC beam optics, and detector alignment techniques, along with their application in the selection of signal collision events. The track reconstruction is performed by exploiting hit cluster information through a novel method using a common polygonal area in the intercept-slope plane. The technique is applied in the relative alignment of detector layers with $\u03bc$m precision. A tag-and-probe method is used to extract strip-level detection efficiencies. The alignment of the Roman pot system is performed through time-dependent adjustments, resulting in a position accuracy of 3 $\u03bc$m in the horizontal and 60 $\u03bc$m in the vertical directions. The goal is to provide an optimal reconstruction tool for central exclusive physics analyses based on the high-$\u03b2^*$ data-taking period at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in 2018.",

The analysis uses proton-proton collision data collected at the CERN LHC with the CMS experiment at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. No signal is observed. Upper limits on the product of the cross section and branching fractions are derived for narrow resonances A and H with masses up to 2100 and 2000 GeV, respectively, assuming A boson production through gluon fusion. The results are also interpreted within two-Higgs-doublet models, where A and H are CP-odd and CP-even states, respectively, complementing and substantially extending the reach of previous searches.",

An excess of events with a large imbalance of transverse momentum is searched for across 0, 1 and 2 lepton final states. Novel multivariate techniques are used to take advantage of the differences in kinematic properties between the two DM production mechanisms. No significant deviations with respect to the standard model predictions are observed. The results are interpreted considering a simplified model in which the mediator is either a scalar or pseudoscalar particle and couples to top quarks and to DM fermions. Axion-like particles that are coupled to top quarks and DM fermions are also considered. Expected exclusion limits of 410 and 380 GeV for scalar and pseudoscalar mediator masses, respectively, are set at the 95% confidence level. A DM particle mass of 1 GeV is assumed, with mediator couplings to fermions and DM particles set to unity. A small signal-like excess is observed in data, with the largest local significance observed to be 1.9 standard deviations for the 150 GeV pseudoscalar mediator hypothesis. Because of this excess, mediator masses are only excluded below 310 (320) GeV for the scalar (pseudoscalar) mediator. The results are also translated into model-independent 95% confidence level upper limits on the visible cross section of DM production in association with top quarks, ranging from 1 pb to 0.02 pb.",

The analysis is based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 101 fb$^{-1}$ collected in 2017$-$2018. No significant excess over the expected standard model background is observed. This result is interpreted within the frameworks of the 2HDM+a and baryonic Z$'$ benchmark simplified models. The 2HDM+a model is a type-II two-Higgs-doublet model featuring a heavy pseudoscalar with an additional light pseudoscalar. Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the production cross section and the branching fraction for each of these two simplified models. Heavy pseudoscalar boson masses between 400 and 700 GeV are excluded for a light pseudoscalar mass of 100 GeV. For the baryonic Z$'$ model, a statistical combination is made with an earlier search based on a data set of 36 fb$^{-1}$ collected in 2016.

Photographic plates and related materials (logbooks, envelopes, etc.) were scanned with commercial flatbed scanners. Astrometric and photometric calibrations were carried out with the developed PyPlate software, using Gaia EDR3 data as a reference. The APPLAUSE data publication complies with IVO standards. The latest data release contains images and metadata from 27 plate collections from the partner institutes in Hamburg, Bamberg, and Potsdam, along with digitised archives provided by Tautenburg, Tartu, and Vatican observatories. Altogether, over two billion calibrated measurements extracted from about 70,000 direct photographic plates can readily be used to create long-term light curves. For instance, we constructed the historic light curve of the enigmatic dipping star KIC 8462852. We found no evidence of previously assumed variations on timescales of decades in our light curve. Potential uses of APPLAUSE images for transient sources can be appreciated by following the development of the nova shell of GK Per (1901) over time and the change in brightness of two extragalactic supernovae. The database holds about 10,000 spectral plates. We made use of objective prism plates to follow the temporal changes of Nova DN Gem through 1912 and 1913, highlighting an outburst in early 1913.",

We present the identification of X-ray galaxy groups using a combination of RASS and SDSS data. We include new X-ray reanalysis of RASS, to include very extended (up to a size of half a degree) sources and account for differences in the limiting sensitivity towards compact and very extended X-ray emission. X-ray groups exhibit less scatter in the scaling relations and selecting the groups based on the extended X-ray emission leads to an additional scatter reduction. Most of the scatter for the optical groups is associated with a small (6%) fraction of outliers, primarily associated with low optical luminosity groups found in dense regions of the cosmic web. These groups are the primary candidates for being the contaminants in the optical group catalogues. Removing those groups from the optical group sample using optically measured properties only, leads to a substantial reduction in the scatter in the most scaling relations of the optical groups. We find a density dependence of both the X-ray and optical luminosity of groups, which we associate with the assembly bias. Abridged.",

PPC processes only a fraction of the total power flowing between input and output, or source and load, which results in a very high efficiency and power density. Even though PPC has been used in two-port applications, further research is still required to understand PPC in multi-port applications fully. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to investigate a three-port PPC for integrating photovoltaic (PV)/battery systems in dc microgrids. This work proposes a dual-input single-output (DISO) system that forms the two PPC submodules by connecting a PV and a battery to the dc bus via an individual series port of dc-dc cell. Furthermore, this work provided a cost-effective soft switching solution using a current-fed resonant push-pull configuration in PPC. The suggested PV/battery system based on DISO-PPC architecture is validated using PSIM simulation in conjunction with PV and battery voltage variation, maximum power point tracking, and battery current management.",

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine a generalized PPC multiport system network. In this paper, a dual-input single-output (DISO) system is proposed that connects the battery packs to the dc bus through the individual dc-dc cell which makes the two PPC submodules. Moreover, this paper used a current-fed resonant push-pull configuration in PPC to offer an economical solution with soft switching.

UVIT DR1 includes bright UV sources in 291 fields that UVIT detected during its first 2 yr of pointed observation, encompassing an area of 58 deg2. We used the ccdlab pipeline to reduce the Level 1 data, SExtractor for source detection, and four photometric procedures to determine the magnitudes of the detected sources. We provided the 3σ and 5σ detection limits for all the filters of UVIT. We describe the details of observation, source extraction methods, and photometry procedures applied to prepare the catalog. In the final UVIT DR1 catalog, we have point sources, extended sources, clumps from nearby galaxies, globular clusters, open clusters, planetary nebulae, and gaseous nebulae. There are 239,520 unique sources in the combined UVIT DR1, of which 70,488 sources have FUV magnitudes, and 211,410 have NUV magnitudes.

We study the basic properties of these galaxy groups to gain insights into the effect of different group selections on the properties. In addition to X-ray luminosity coming from shallow survey data of RASS, we have obtained detailed X-ray properties of the groups by matching the AXES-2MRS catalogue to archival X-ray observations by XMM-Newton and complemented this by adding the published XMM-Newton results on galaxy clusters in our catalogue. We analyse temperature and density to the lowest overdensity accessible by the data, obtaining hydrostatic mass estimates and comparing them to the velocity dispersions of the groups. We find a large spread in the central mass to virial mass ratios for galaxy groups in the XMM-Newton subsample. This can either indicate large non-thermal pressure of galaxy groups affecting our X-ray mass measurements, or the effect of a diversity of halo concentrations on X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Previous catalogues, based on detecting the peak of the X-ray emission preferentially sample the high-concentration groups, while our new catalogue includes many low-concentration groups. Abridged.",

We present the Galaxy Spectra Network/GaSNet-II, a supervised multinetwork deep learning tool for spectra classification and redshift prediction. GaSNet-II can be trained to identify a customized number of classes and optimize the redshift predictions. Redshift errors are determined via an ensemble/pseudo-Monte Carlo test obtained by randomizing the weights of the network-of-networks structure. As a demonstration of the capability of GaSNet-II, we use 260k Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra from Data Release 16, separated into 13 classes including 140k galactic, and 120k extragalactic objects. GaSNet-II achieves 92.4 per cent average classification accuracy over the 13 classes and mean redshift errors of approximately 0.23 per cent for galaxies and 2.1 per cent for quasars. We further train/test the pipeline on a sample of 200k 4MOST (4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope) mock spectra and 21k publicly released DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) spectra. On 4MOST mock data, we reach 93.4 per cent accuracy in 10-class classification and mean redshift error of 0.55 per cent for galaxies and 0.3 per cent for active galactic nuclei. On DESI data, we reach 96 per cent accuracy in (star/galaxy/quasar only) classification and mean redshift error of 2.8 per cent for galaxies and 4.8 per cent for quasars, despite the small sample size available. GaSNet-II can process ∼40k spectra in less than one minute, on a normal Desktop GPU.

We calibrated literature mass estimates from various surveys against each other and provide an initial mass estimate for each cluster, which we used to define the radial extent of the 4MOST coverage.

This work proposes a soft start implementation method to limit the inrush currents by implementing a simple PI-based topology morphing control.

To tackle the typical challenges of FL—such as high communication overhead, resource limitations, and convergence inefficiencies—our method integrates dynamic client clustering, quantization-aware training, and structured model pruning. These optimizations collectively reduce latency and memory consumption while accelerating model convergence. Evaluations using the Human Activity Recognition dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art FL methods, achieving an average increase of +8.4% in accuracy, ‑16.2% lower latency, ‑35.1% reduction in memory usage, and ‑2.7% lower security overhead.

A substantial number of observational and modelling studies have been undertaken with the aim of identifying the dependence of spin orientation on the components of the large-scale structure. However, the findings of these studies remain contradictory. In this paper, we present an analysis of the orientation of the spins of 2 861 galaxies with respect to the filaments of the large-scale structure of the Universe. All galaxies in our sample have an inclination to the line of sight greater than 85 degrees, enabling an unambiguous determination of the spin axis direction in space. We investigate the alignment of galaxy spin axes relative to cosmic web filaments as a function of various properties for galaxies. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for the galaxy spin axes to align along the filament axes of the large-scale structure.",

We study the substructure, connectivity, and galaxy content of galaxy clusters A1656 and A1367 in the Coma supercluster and of A1185 in the Leo supercluster with the aim of understanding the evolution of clusters from turnaround to virialisation, and the evolution of whole superclusters. We used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR10 MAIN galaxy sample and from DESI cluster catalogues. The projected phase space diagram and the distribution of mass were used to identify regions of various infall stages (early and late infall, and regions of ongoing infall, i.e. regions of influence), their characteristic radii, embedded mass, and density contrasts in order to study the evolution of clusters with the spherical collapse model. We determined the substructure of clusters using normal mixture modelling and their connectivity by counting filaments in the cluster's regions of influence. We analysed galaxy content in clusters and in their environment and derived scaling relations between cluster masses. All three clusters have a substructure with two to five components and up to six filaments connected to them. The radii of regions of influence are R_ inf ≈ 4 and the density contrast at their borders is Δρ_ inf ≈ 50 - 60. The scaling relations between the masses of clusters have a very small scatter. The galaxy content of the clusters and of their regions of influence vary from cluster to cluster. In high-density regions (superclusters), the percentage of quiescent galaxies is higher than in low-density regions between superclusters, where approximately one-fourth of the galaxies are still quiescent. The collapse of the regions of influence of clusters started at redshifts z ≈ 0.4 - 0.5. Clusters will be virialised approximately in ≈ 3.3 Gyrs. Clusters in superclusters will not merge, and their present-day turnaround regions will be virialised in ≈ 10 Gyrs. The large variety of properties of clusters suggests that they have followed different paths during evolution."
